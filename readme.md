# ReactiveCocoa - Swift Playgrounds 

This is a walkthrough of ReactiveCocoa 4.x using Swift Playgrounds.

This uses ReactiveCocoa 4.x installed via CocoaPods - you shouldn't need cocoapods installed to start running the playgrounds.  If you need to update the ReactiveCocoa library, you'll need CocoaPods 1.0.0.beta.2 or higher to do this.

## Usage Directions

1. Open the workspace file (req'd due to use of cocoapods)
2. Within the xcode project, open the swift playground files.
3. Run and play!
