# ReactiveCocoa - Swift Playgrounds 

This is a walkthrough of ReactiveCocoa 4.x using Swift Playgrounds.

This uses ReactiveCocoa 4.x installed via CocoaPods - you shouldn't need cocoapods installed to start running the playgrounds.  If you need to update the ReactiveCocoa library, you'll need CocoaPods 1.0.0.beta.2 or higher to do this.

## Usage Directions

1. Open the workspace file (req'd due to use of cocoapods)
2. For the first run, Build the project once (cmd+b) - this because the playground files have the project's build output as a dependency in order to reference the ReactiveCocoa framework.  
3. Within the xcode project, open the swift playground files. If you see an error on the 'import ReactiveCocoa' line, try closing/reopening the playground file (and make sure you followed step 2).
4. Run and play!
